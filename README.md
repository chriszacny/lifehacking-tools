## Overview

Welcome to my Lifehacking Tools repo, with advice from many excellent sources.

As a Software Engineer, I tend to like to stay focused and on task. 

As such while I love to read lifehacking books and blogs with tons of anecdotes, I also like checklists and flowcharts. 

Therefore, I have created several flowcharts that I find useful, professionaly and personally.

Feel free to use them yourself and modify them for your needs, but I'd recommend reading through the References below, so you can develop your own personal flowcharts.

**TIP: Some of these flowcharts are large - Right Click and Open Image in New Tab.**
